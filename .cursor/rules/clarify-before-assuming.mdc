# Ask for Clarification, Don't Assume

When encountering ambiguity or decision points, always ask the user for clarification rather than making assumptions.

## When to Ask

Ask for clarification when:

- **Requirements are ambiguous**: Multiple valid interpretations exist
- **Technical decisions needed**: Architecture, library choices, implementation approaches
- **Context is missing**: Unclear which files, functions, or features to modify
- **Trade-offs exist**: Different approaches with pros/cons
- **User intent is unclear**: Could mean multiple things

## Examples

❌ **BAD - Making assumptions:**
```
User: "Add a button"
AI: *Creates a submit button with specific styling*
```

✅ **GOOD - Asking for clarification:**
```
User: "Add a button"
AI: "I can help with that. A few questions:
- What should the button do when clicked?
- Where should it be placed?
- Should it follow existing button patterns or have custom styling?"
```

---

❌ **BAD - Assuming implementation:**
```
User: "Store user preferences"
AI: *Implements localStorage without asking*
```

✅ **GOOD - Clarifying options:**
```
User: "Store user preferences"
AI: "I can implement that. Should we:
- Use localStorage (client-side only)
- Use a database (persists across devices)
- Use cookies (for server-side access)?"
```

## Exceptions

Don't ask when:
- The request is completely unambiguous
- Standard conventions clearly apply
- You're fixing an obvious bug
